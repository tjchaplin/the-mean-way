# HTML5 With Javascript and CSS3

## Introduction

I thought it would be interesting to apply the MEAN stack when teaching HTML5.  These samples and exercises are meant to be introduction to creating HTML5 applications using the MEAN stack.

The following provides my opinions and experiences in creating an HTML5 application, using Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node Js.

## Getting Started

### Installing Node
Follow the instructions on the [Nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) site to install the latest version

### Using the source code
The source code provided with this data contains tags for each topic. For example Topic 10 can be located in the source code tags through the github UI or through git as follows:
1. find the tag associated with the module:
```
git tags --list
```
2. Check out the tag:
```
git checkout tags/<TagName>
//git checkout tags/Module10
//Now your source code will point to that tag
```

For more information on how to use git and tags check the [git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation)
